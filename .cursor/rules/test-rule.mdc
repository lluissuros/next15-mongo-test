# Test Rule

Hello! This is a test rule created to demonstrate the Cursor Rules feature.

## Purpose

This rule serves as an example of how Cursor Rules work:

- Rules are stored in `.cursor/rules/` directory
- They use `.mdc` extension
- They contain frontmatter metadata
- They use Markdown formatting

## When This Rule Applies

This rule has `alwaysApply: false`, which means it won't be automatically applied. You can manually reference it when needed.

Feel free to modify or delete this test rule!
